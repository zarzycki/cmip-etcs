- Get candidate cyclones and verify that they are bit-for-bit identical for overlapping times (e.g., timestride of 1 vs timestride of 6)
- Run a "control" StitchNodes using Gore et al., 2023 configuration
- Run a sensitivity experiment of hourly StitchNodes to figure out what is the best RMSE of the density to the 6-hourly data (sens.sh and testing.sh)
- Call the lowest RMSE value the "most 6-hourly" config for hourly data (RMSE.py)
- NOTE: This may not be the optimal hourly tracking config but gives the most 6-hourly like results.
